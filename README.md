1.                     Answer BOTH   parts of the question
Virtual   screening   against   5-hydroxytryptamine   receptor   (5-HT2C)   resulted   in   a   set of    ten small molecules as   potential agonists.a)                      Discuss   the   key   factors   involved   in   the   design   and   evaluation   of   CNS   drugs   and    propose   a   strategy   for   selection   of   two    compounds   for   further    in    vivo   experiments.

b)                      Propose the   use of two commonly   used   methods for   in   vivo   evaluation   of their   CNS   penetration and provide the justification for this choice.       (40% of marks)
2.                     Answer BOTH   parts of the questionYou are aiming to develop small molecule compounds to target a newly   identified   binding   pocket adjacent to an activation   loop   of a   protein   kinase   and   have available both the human apoprotein and homologous ligand bound   structures   determined   by x-ray   crystallography to   better than   2.5 Å   resolution.   Significant   differences   are   observed   between the   apoprotein   and   homologous   structures with some additional disorder in the target   binding   pocket.
a)                   Describe how   you might utilise these structures   along with molecular   modelling techniques   and with   the   use   of molecular   mechanics to   understand   the   observed   differences between   the   two   structures   and how   this   can    be   used   to   build   a   representative   binding   pocket.   Also   discuss   how   you   might   explore structural aspects of the binding pocket    as a starting point for   structure-based   drug   design. Include in your answer the limitations of the   methods used.                                                                           (60% of marks)
b)                   Your collaborators provide you with coordinates for the target       kinase   identifying   a   small   molecule   fragment   in   the   binding   pocket   better   than   1.5   Å   resolution. Explain how you might grow this   fragment using computational   based approaches 代 写PHAY0020 THE PROCESS OF DRUG DISCOVERYHaskell

3.                     Answer ALL   parts of the questionA scientist in a biotech company believeshe has discovered a novel cell surface   receptor with   an   important   stimulatory   role   in   cell   division   that   might   make   it   a   good drug target in the treatment of renal   cancer.   His   discovery was   made   in   a   kidney cell   culture.
a)                   When   trying   to   convince   his   project   manager, what   sort   of   properties   must   he   demonstrate that the   protein   receptor possesses to be a good   drug   target?        (25% of marks)b)                   The   scientist   would   like   the   company   geneticist   to   carry   out   a   Genome   Wide   Association   Study   (GWAS).   Explain   to   his   project   manager   what   this   would   involve and what   it   might show.                                       (25% of marks)
c)                      The scientist   proposes to   use   his   kidney cell culture to validate   his   receptor   as   a   potential   drug   target.   Explain   with   molecular   detail   TWO   possible   methods   that   the   scientist   might   use.   Highlight   any   difficulties   and   how   they   might   be   overcome.                                                                                   (50% of marks)
4.                        Answer BOTH   parts of the question:
A small pharmaceutical company has decided to initiate a drug discovery   project against Type 2   Diabetes   Mellitus.
The   Board   of   Directors   are   split   between   whether   to   pursue   lead   compounds   from natural products or chemically   synthesized   sources.
a)                   Write a report for the Board of Directors outlining the advantages and
disadvantages and the difficulties and solutions for drug discovery from natural   products.   Use examples where   possible to   illustrate your arguments.           (40% of marks)
b)                      Explain   to   the   Board   of   Directors   how   large   libraries   of   chemical   compounds   can   be   synthesized   and   then   interrogated   for   lead   compounds.   Highlight   the   advantages and disadvantages of these   techniques.       (60% of   marks)
